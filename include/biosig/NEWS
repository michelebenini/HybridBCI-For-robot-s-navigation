    New Release: Dataformat 1.40 
	see release notes for more details 

Apr 16, 2004 
    EEG data of the Graz BCI experiments are saved in GDF format using the BIOSIG toolbox: 
    The Event Codes as proposed in http://dpmi.tu-graz.ac.at/~schloegl/matlab/eeg/EventCodes.html
    are implemented in the GDF format. This allows to save EEG data and Events in a single file. 
    The advantage of this solution is based on some modifications of the originally, simple 
    EDF format. 

April 16th, 2004
    Thanks to Robert Oostenveld's effort, 
    support for 3 more data formats is included. 
    BrainVision, FIF and EEProbe are supported now.
